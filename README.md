Fantasy Race Pack (CK3 mod)

!Hello to all!

I've created this mod to play around with tools given to us by the wonderful devs at Paradox Interactive (seriously, their note have been a lifesaver); the highlight of my mod are the racial traits I've created using the new trait exp and the levelling system brought by the 1.9 updates along with the tours and tournaments DLC. 



The traits currently in the game have 3 tiers for the 4 Species in the game.

Example:
group = blood_alfar

alfar (+1) - Alfar partal decent
blood_alfar_1 
Mature at 16 years old
Become elderly at 60 years old

alfar (+2) - Half Alfar 
blood_alfar_2 
Mature at 16 years old
Become elderly at 90 years old

alfar (+3) - Alfar 
blood_alfar_3
Mature at 45 years old
Become elderly at 100 years old



Currently, I've added the Species from Norse mythology and some variants to go along with them.

Elves(Alfar, Dryad, Jann)
Dwarves/Goblins(Dvergar, Goblin, Mara)
Orcs(Orkai)



There are 3 new Casus beli Migration wars types.

Kingdom Migration & Duchy Migration that all the fantasy races can use to expand the land their people inhabit across the map.

Great Steppe nomad migration used to cause large steppe empires and the movement of steppe peoples seen in our real history.

I'll continue to change and improve this mod as I grow as a Computer Scientist, Lover of history, and Overall nerd :P

!Enjoy!
